# Contributing

## Scope
- Keep workflows **reproducible** (pin Metashape version tested, document key settings).
- Prefer **small sample configs** and **clear QC checks** over “one-off” scripts.

## Pull requests
Include:
- Metashape version tested
- A short “input assumptions” section
- Expected outputs + QC gates
- Config diff + rationale

## No data
Do not commit:
- raw photos
- full Metashape projects (.psx/.psz)
- huge exports
Use external storage and link in workflow docs.
